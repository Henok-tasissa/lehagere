				 When people start talking about modern technology, Snap chat is one of the biggest company in technology world. Snapchat is an Android and iOS app. One of the core concepts of the app is that any pictures or videos or messages you send are only available for a short time before they become inaccessible. The temporary, or ephemeral, nature of the app is thought to encourage a more natural flow of interaction. people text, share moments and helps people interact with each other by sharing locations. It is now the number 1  used social media app in United Sates. It is a technology like Facebook, that makes people life easier by sharing moments each day.  And it is Invented by two Stanford students and friends Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Snapchat’s developer is a public company, called Snap. It claims to be a camera company. As such, it creates other products, including hardware, like Snapchat Spectacles. Also, Snapchat is colloquially referred to as Snap.

				  Spiegel and Murphy met while undergraduates at Stanford. Spiegel dropped out a few weeks before graduation — he only needed three more classes. Spiegel studied product design, while Murphy, two years his senior, majored in Mathimatical and computational science. They’re also Kappa Sigma fraternity brothers. Spiegel was social chair of his company, which is interesting, since he seems to rub a lot of people the wrong way The administration kicked the frat off Stanford’s campus in the fall of 2010 for hosting an alcohol-laden party during a strictly "dry" weekend. Spiegel’s parents are successful lawyers. Melissa and John Spiegel hold degrees from Harvard and Yale, respectively. Given the lawsuits surrounding Reggie Brown's equity in the company, maybe that's a good thing. Spiegel's parents divorced in 2007, but he is staying with his dad until he gates kicked out.Murphy’s parents work for the state of California. His mother also emigrated from Philippines.

				Prior to Snapchat, social media was very desktop-based, and it was all about accumulating data, like statuses or tweets or photos and videos, and you'd post all those things online so that all your friends could comment on them and you'd keep them forever. In other words, Snapchat has changed the way we communicate online.

				Murphy and Spiegel had an earlier business venture that failed. Future Fresheman, which debuted in the summer of 2010, was designed to help high schoolers, parents and counselors deal with the stressful college admissions process. The site ended up being remarkably full-featured, but they never convinced anyone to use it. "We got, like, maybe five people on the service," Spiegel told Forbes. After meeting with Mark Zuckerberg a little over a year ago, Spiegel and Murphy ordered Sun Tzu’s The Art of War for each of their six employees. Zuckerberg had secretly met Spiegel and Murphy in Los Angeles, outlining his vision for Snapchat and describing Facebook’s lookalike product, poke, which would launch in a matter of days.Evan Spiegle co-founder and CEO, and Bobby Murphy, co-founder and CTO, somehow found themselves just as famous for creating the revolutionary disappearing-image app as they are for turning down a $3 billion offer from Facebook. And they're not even 30 years old.

				In 2012, Spiegel and Murphy desperately needed investment money to cover the cost of their computer servers — 40,000 users meant they were already maxing out their credit cards. Spiegel met with Sierra Ventures’ founder Peter C. Wendell and Silicon Valley PR and communications big shot Raymond Nasr, both professors at Stanford’s business school. He explained they needed the money but refused their suggestion of meeting with either venture capitalists or Twitter. He didn’t want to lose company control, and was afraid the people at Twitter would steal the idea. He was, however, open to meeting with Google’s venture capital arm.

				 In conclusion, Snapchat has changed the way we communicate online. With it, you can quickly send a photo of yourself at work to a friend, maybe with a rainbow-puking AR lens applied or a doodle scribbled on top, and then they can open it, screenshot it if they want, and reply back with their own photo or video response, which they can also broadcast to their story for friends and followers to see. So we have to applaud these people for what they did to technology and change people lives.
