			Social media is one of the most influential aspect of modern time. It took over everything that exists
in the environment. People use social media every day. They are able to connect easily with others
through social media. One of the huge part of this connection is Facebook. Facebook is one of the most
used and profitable company in the world. More than billion people use Facebook. People share photos,
videos and they can communicate easily with their collogues through Facebook. But most people
doesn’t know who created and who is behind this platform. One of the founders of facebook is Mark
Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg is co-founder and CEO of the social-networking website Facebook, as well
as one of the world&#39;s youngest billionaires.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mark Zuckerberg, one of the five co-founders of Facebook, knew exactly what he was doing when he
propelled himself into the computer programming business. As a young entrepreneur, Zuckerberg
learned that in order to be successful, you must have three key attributes; ambition, creativity, and risk-
tolerance. He was kicked out of Harvard University. But that doesn’t make him stop his dream to be one
of the world most influential person in the world. Another key attribute that Zuckerberg has is creativity.
The development of Facebook was an imaginative idea: having friends and family connect over long
distances through images, text status updates, and a personalized forum. When Facebook first hit the
Internet, it was plain in design and easy to navigate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mark Zuckerberg has inspired most young scholars around the world. The likes of him and other
technology people has made people life easier and make the earth smaller through network
communication. Everything in the planet especially in the developed and developing countries
computers are becoming the daily life of people. Zuckerberg has taken many risks to claim his way to

fame. One of the main risks any businessperson faces is the factor of their product not selling. In
Zuckerberg’s case, his main concern was whether or not Internet users would latch onto Facebook,
considering the competition that was present at the time in social media (Rand 46). In addition,
Zuckerberg faced the danger of adopting Facebook from another source, as it could have been easily
referred to as a copy of a concept that was already patented.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are lots of advantages and disadvantages of Facebook. When you meet someone, instead of
getting his or her number, we now say, “Find me on Facebook.” Social media has drastically grown over
the past years. First it was just msn messenger or email. Out of nowhere Facebook was created and now
everything is about Mark Zuckerberg. In the TED talk Stefana Broadbent mentions a couple from Italy
who live in Sao Paulo how they Skype with there family and once a night they set down the computer in
the dinner table and have dinner with there family. Skype is one of the best social media, for families
across the world and even the soldiers who are serving overseas are able to see their families. These
days we exchange information by telling others how to find us on Facebook. It is common in my
generation. Social media has taken over our lives for the worse.
		</p>
		<p>
			So in general, people like Mark Zuckerberg should always be praised and acknowledged of everything
they have done for the social media. They have created different kinds of platforms which make people
life easier by connecting and communicating easier. Billion people are using this platform and it’s going
to grow with young people coming in the technology department.
