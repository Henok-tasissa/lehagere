Lovelace was driven and come in the eyes of everyone because of her passion and love for mathematics. She had incredible writing ability of computer programs. Ada mom recognizes her talent in the beginning and she hired one tutor for her to enhance her logical thinking. Her studies included science and mathematics. She wanted her daughter to get a chance to develop her career even though it was very uncommon those days.
