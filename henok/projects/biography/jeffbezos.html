				American entrepreneur Jeff Bezos is the founder and chief executive officer of
				Amazon.com and owner of The Washington Post. His successful business ventures
				have made him one of the richest person in the world. Entrepreneur and e-commerce
				pioneer Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Bezos had
				an early love of computers and studied computer science and electrical engineering at
				Princeton University. After graduation he worked on Wall Street, and in 1990 he
				became the youngest senior vice president at the investment firm D.E. Shaw. Four
				years later, he quit his lucrative job to open Amazon.com, a virtual bookstore that
				became one of the internet&#39;s biggest success stories.
			</p>

			<p>In 1995, on July 16 Bezos create Amazon.com. Bezos set up the office for his fledgling company in
				his garage where, along with a few employees, he began developing software. They expanded
				operations into a two-bedroom house, equipped with three Sun Micro stations, and eventually
				developed a test site. The initial success of the company was meteoric. With no press
				promotion, Amazon.com sold books across the United States and in 45 foreign countries within
				30 days. In two months, sales reached $20,000 a week, growing faster than Bezos and his
				start-up team had envisioned.

			<p>In 1997, Amazon.com went public leading many market analysts to question whether the
				company could hold its own when traditional retailers launched their own e-commerce sites.
				Two years later, the start-up not only kept up, but also outpaced competitors, becoming an e-
				commerce leader. Bezos continued to diversify Amazon’s offerings with the sale of CDs and
				videos in 1998, and later clothes, electronics, toys and more through major retail partnerships.
				While many dot.coms of the early &#39;90s went bust, Amazon flourished with yearly sales that
				jumped from $510,000 in 1995 to over $17 billion in 2011.

				In early December 2013, Bezos made headlines on Amazon Prime &amp; Amazon Studios
				when he revealed a new, experimental initiative by Amazon, called &quot;Amazon Prime
				Air,&quot; using drones remote controlled machines that can perform an array of human tasks
				to provide delivery services to customers. According to Bezos, these drones are able to
				carry items weighing up to five pounds, and are capable of traveling within a 10-mile
				distance of the company&#39;s distribution center. He also stated that Prime Air could
				become a reality within as little as four or five years.

				On January 30, 2018, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase
				delivered a joint press release in which they announced plans to pool their resources to
				form a new healthcare company for their U.S. employees. According to the release, the
				company will be &quot;free from profit-making incentives and constraints&quot; as it tries to find
				ways to cut costs and boost satisfaction for patients, with an initial focus on technology
				solutions. “The healthcare system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-
				eyed about the degree of difficulty,&quot; said Bezos. &quot;Hard as it might be, reducing
				healthcare&#39;s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their
				families would be worth the effort.&quot;

				In this success story, we are going to share Jeff Bezos biography, an
				American entrepreneur and e-commerce pioneer, the creator of online store
				Amazon.com. He is also the founder of Blue Origin, a company that aims to
				make space travel affordable to ordinary people. Bezos always has his
				customer in mind, no matter what he is working on. His number one priority
				is making it as available and easily accessible as possible. A hyper-
				intelligent, ultra-driven individual, Bezos’s a dual-personality can turn him
				from a compassionate person.
